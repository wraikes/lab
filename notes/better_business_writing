Better Business Writing
############

Lesson 1:
- write clear english:
	- not necessarily a ban on jargon
\	- people want simplicity; don't make them work for it
	- have a good idea of the reading age (14-16 is for educated crowd)

Lesson 2:
- understand the main questions before writing:
	- what are your objectives?
	- what is your voice? who am I?
	- who are your readers?
- objective: what's the point?
	- what is the desired outcome? 
		- do you want the reader to think, feel or do? 
		- be clear on the outcome
	- SMART: specific, measurable, assign, realistic, time-related (deadlines)
- reader:
	- write for your reader; not yourself
	- who is the reader? pick a specific person to focus on; tailor the message for them
	- what do they want?
	- what feelings will the reader have? how does this impact my writing?
- my voice: who am I? who do I want to be?
	- dictates the style; friendly, formal, etc.
	- consistency is key across multiple writers & brand

Lesson 3:
- structure: make an outline of what to include
	- guide your reader to your conclusion
- could/should/must: be ruthless
	- what must you include? everything else is superfluous
	- be similar to an elevator pitch
- get them what they need right away
	- don't make the reader dig
	- important info up front, get straight to the point
	- if it doesn't support objective directly; don't include.

Lesson 4:
- use common, simple, precise words for best chance of achieving objectives
	- it's not dumbing down, but speeding up; increased fluency
- sentence length should be short:
	- strive for less clauses per sentence (1 to 2 points per sentence)
	- lead with the problem that the writing will solve
	- contain about 15-20 words
- sentence padding:
	- cut all tautologies (redundant words)
	- cut all phrases that don't impact the meaning
- paragraphs:
	- includes a single discrete idea or topic
	- white space is your friend; use short paragraphs
	- begin with a topic sentence.  provides headsup of paragraph topic
	- include 2-4 other sentences (rule of thumb)
	- paragraphs should be mutable:
		- try to move paragraphs around to improve flow
- review it:
	- does it achieve objective? 
	- is it suitable for the reader? 
	- can it be more elegant, brief, etc.?

Lesson 5:
- logical argument (logos): 
	- this is the objective
	- and these are the arguments to support this
- emotional connection (pathos):
	- use passion
	- use metaphors to conjure images or ideas
	- why should they care? can a story be used here?
- credibility (ethos):
	- why should the reader believe me?
	- I can borrow others' credibility (via quotes)

Lesson 6:
- almost always use active voice: subject, verb, object
	- "The dog chased the cat."
- passive is for deflection or focusing on receiver: object, verb
	- "The cat was chased by the dog." (usually include "by")
- use verbs not nouns: don't nomalize verbs ("ment"; "ing"; "ion"; etc.)
	- "please submit your application" vs. "please apply"
- keep it about people; not services, systems or abstract ideas
	- what will it mean for the people? how will it affect them?
- what do you want from the reader?  be explicit, no ambiguity
- avoid jargon and assumed knowledge; acronyms; etc.

Lesson 7:
- editing: 
	- slow down!!
	- celebrate mistakes
	- place yourself in the reader's shoes
- objective testing: did I meet all objectives; was it SMART?
- shorten work as much as possible
- clarity >>> brevity
- ask whether someone I know would understand it
- grab attention within first 20 seconds































I have appealed the decision to move from London to Birmingham.  I expect that they will explain why they did not consult with employees.
